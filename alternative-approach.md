# Alternative Image Display Approaches

## Current Approach (Applied)
- Square format with object-cover
- 4 products per row on large screens
- No black spaces, some cropping possible

## Alternative Approach (Option 2)
```css
// Smaller cards that match image proportions
aspect-ratio: 3/4  // Taller rectangles
object-contain    // No cropping
basis-1/5         // 5 products per row
```

## Recommendation
The current square approach works best for e-commerce because:
1. Consistent visual grid
2. More products visible 
3. Professional appearance
4. Standard for plant/product catalogs
