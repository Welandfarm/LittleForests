Yes, when you integrate your website via an API, external websites can fetch all data from your Supabase database including images, but there are important considerations about where and how they should access the images.

Current Setup Analysis:
Your current setup stores images in Supabase Storage with public URLs like:

https://mjsuwlpixcregiikiusd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/plant-images/plants/1753349665624-4p66xqfio38.jpg
API Integration Options:
Option 1: Direct Supabase Access (Recommended)
The external website can:

✅ Fetch inventory data directly from your Supabase database
✅ Access images directly from Supabase Storage via the public URLs
✅ Get real-time updates when you add new inventory
Option 2: Custom API Endpoint
Create an API endpoint in your app that serves the data:

app/api/inventory/route.ts
Create API endpoint for external website integration
Image Access Strategy:
For External Websites:
Direct Image URLs (Recommended):

External websites can use the image_url field directly
Images are served from Supabase CDN (fast and reliable)
No additional processing needed
Example API Response:

{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "b2d0e617-6f07-46fb-a14c-cae078a68dfd",
      "plant_name": "Honey",
      "scientific_name": "Raw Honey",
      "category": "Organic Honey",
      "price": 1000,
      "quantity": 200,
      "image_url": "https://mjsuwlpixcregiikiusd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/plant-images/plants/1753349665624-4p66xqfio38.jpg",
      "available_for_purchase": true
    }
  ]
}
Security Considerations:
Database Access:
✅ Read-only access for external websites
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) already configured
✅ Public read permissions are safe for inventory data
Image Access:
✅ Public bucket allows direct image access
✅ CDN delivery provides fast image loading
✅ No authentication required for viewing images
Integration Example for External Website:
// External website can fetch like this:
const response = await fetch('https://your-app-url.replit.dev/api/inventory?available_only=true')
const { data } = await response.json()
// Use images directly
data.forEach(item => {
  if (item.image_url) {
    // Display image directly from Supabase
    const img = document.createElement('img')
    img.src = item.image_url
    img.alt = item.plant_name
  }
})
Recommended Approach:
Use the API endpoint approach because it gives you:

✅ Control over what data is exposed
✅ Ability to filter and format data
✅ Analytics on API usage
✅ Future flexibility for authentication if needed
✅ Direct image URLs from Supabase Storage
The external website will get both the inventory data and direct access to your images through the Supabase CDN, providing optimal performance and reliability.
